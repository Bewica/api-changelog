# Bewica API v1.0 Changelog

Changes from Bewica API v0.1

## Backwards incompatible changes

- Header to supply the API key is `apiKey` instead of `x-api-key`
- API key as query parameter support dropped
- Base url is now [`https://api.bewica.com/`](https://api.bewica.com/)

## Backwards compatible changes

- New functionality on quotes and general bug fixes
    - Query companies house by company_number
    - Better date fields handling (policy_start_date and such)
    - Documentation updates, better descriptions
- New API to **get Schedule documents by email or by redirection**
    - Will only serve documents for test policies or ‘Bound’ policies
    - Exposed endpoints behind API key are:
        - `GET /email_documents` - will serve documents to a given `destination_email`
        - `GET /serve_documents` - will produce a signed url valid for 10 minutes and redirect the request to it
- New API to handle credentials
    - Each partner gets 3 keys
        - Test key: use it to test the API, has no effect whatsoever
        - Production key: this is the key to use all our APIs
        - Admin key: the key used to communicate with the credentials API
    - **Credentials API** allows authenticated partners with an Admin API key to
        - `POST /revoke_key` - for test and production keys
        - `POST /generate_key` - for test and production keys
        - `GET /test_key` - for test keys only, production keys will only be seen once upon generation
- New API versioning scheme
    - Bewica will keep an API version in production as long as one of our partners is using it
    - **Not** versioning through URL anymore (no `https://api.bewica.com/v1/endpoint`)
    - **Versioning via `Accept-Version` header**
        - If header not set, requests are defaulted to the newest API version available when the API key was generated
        - Partners can manage the API version used by setting the `Accept-Version` header in all their request. An example: `Accept-Version: v1`
